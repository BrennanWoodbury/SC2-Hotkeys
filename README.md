# My SC2 Hotkeys

Blizzard doesn't save your hotkeys for you on your profile anymore, I guess, so here I'm saving my SC2 hotkeys. 

It's pretty close to classic with some key differences. 

` = Unit group 0
capsLock = Unit group 9

cancel = z (not escape, escape is unbound, I found it conflicted with trying to use ` as a hotkey) 

Some other variations, but pretty similar-ish to classic.
